# Series Tracker Frontend

## Description

The Series Tracker is a simple web application designed to help users manage their backlog of TV series. It allows users to track the status of their favorite series, monitor their progress, and organize their viewing experience. This frontend is part of an educational exercise for students to practice backend development by implementing the required API endpoints.

## Features

The Series Tracker frontend provides the following capabilities:

### View Series List
- Displays a table of all series in the backlog.
- Includes filters for searching by title, filtering by status, and sorting by ranking.

### Add New Series
- Navigate to a form to add a new series to the backlog.
- Users can specify the title, status, number of episodes watched, total episodes, and ranking.

### Edit Series
- Navigate to a form to edit an existing series.
- Pre-fills the form with the series data for easy updates.

### Track Progress
- Increment the number of episodes watched directly from the series list.

### Update Status
- Change the status of a series (e.g., "Watching", "Completed") directly from the series list.

### Manage Rankings
- Upvote or downvote the ranking of a series based on user preferences.

### Delete Series
- Remove a series from the backlog with a simple confirmation dialog.

## Purpose

This frontend is part of an educational exercise for students to:

### Practice Backend Development
- Students are tasked with implementing the required API endpoints to support the frontend functionality.
- Endpoints include CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and additional actions like incrementing episodes and managing rankings.

### Understand Frontend-Backend Interaction
- Students will learn how the frontend interacts with the backend through HTTP requests.
- Debugging tools like the browser console and network tab can be used to analyze requests and responses.

### Design Better APIs
- By working with the frontend, students will gain insight into how API design impacts usability and functionality.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Implement the backend API endpoints described below to enable full functionality.

## Educational Goals

### Debugging
- Students will encounter common frontend-backend issues (e.g., CORS errors, invalid payloads) and learn how to debug them.

### API Design
- By interacting with the frontend, students will understand how to design APIs that are intuitive and functional.

### Hands-On Practice
- This exercise provides a practical way to apply concepts learned in class, such as HTTP methods, RESTful APIs, and JSON handling.
